# 28h-calc? What?

If you're here then you likely already know [the xkcd](https://xkcd.com/320/) about the 28h day.
Well, I live by it and sometimes things are a little weird when it comes to planning schedules.
I mean the [other calculator](https://28h.t-animal.de/) does help a whole lot but it just doesn't cut it in some cases.
Hence I threw this jumbled mess together in an evening (a morning for y'all, but hey, what are timezones anyway).

You can see the version compiled from the code at time of writing over [here](https://bafybeic6s7azcm35ioz4ntfziqyvoxofdkvmwyy5yacotgfaejk56zmgvq.ipfs.dweb.link) or generally in IPFS via key `/ipfs/bafybeic6s7azcm35ioz4ntfziqyvoxofdkvmwyy5yacotgfaejk56zmgvq`.
